Aldehyde and ketone esters are compounds that are formed when alcohols are broken down into acetaldehyde and acetone. These compounds can be found in a wide variety of foods and beverages, such as beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, fruit juices, and many other foods. They are also found naturally in many plants, including tomatoes, grapes, apples, pears, apricots, peaches, plums, cherries, blueberries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries. The term "ketone" is also used to refer to these compounds, although they are not the same as ketones produced by the body. Ketones are produced in the liver and are used as a source of energy and energy-boosting compounds. A number of different types of keto acids have been identified, but the most well-known are acetoacetate and 2-hydroxybutanoic acid (2-OHB). These are the two most commonly used ketogenic diets, as well as the Atkins diet, which is a low-carbohydrate, high-
