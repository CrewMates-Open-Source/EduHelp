# Subject Predictor

Zero-shot classification pipeline of transformers from hugging face is deployed here to predict the subject for a given question.

For Example, Let's take a mathematics question and predict the output subject .

## Sample Input :
two and two is equal to four?

## Sample output :
![Output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61025442/120218762-d667c400-c257-11eb-9206-df037f9f687c.png)

It can clearly be seen that ,The given question is somewhat logical(scientific) ,but It is a question of mathematics subject.
So is the output graph ,we got.
It has predicted that ,this question belongs to mathematics with an accuracy of approx 73% ,which is quite good score.
