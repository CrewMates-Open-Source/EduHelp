# EduHelp
## What It Does ? :thinking:
**EduHelp** simply mean to make it easier for you to *record any online session*, be it an online lecture, meetings, youtube tutorials, etc. But we are not simply making a web extension or desktop app that records your screen or gives you an audio file in the end. We mean to *save the slide show* or screen presentation going on during those meets as well as the *text file of the entire conversation* that took place. This Project will not only help normal people but also *differently abled people* because the audio is converted to text and a file containing its summary is saved in .txt file as well as *braille scripted file*. The braille file can be given as an input to refreshable braille display (rbd) machines. The audio files can also be used by a blind person for taking note of what happened during class. The screenshots are stored in a .docx file and can be used by a deaf person for revisiting concepts they might miss during classes.
